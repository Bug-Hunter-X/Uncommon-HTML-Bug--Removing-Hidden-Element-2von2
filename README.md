This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML related to removing a hidden element.  In some browsers, attempting to remove an element whose `display` style is set to `none` can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the element not being fully removed or causing errors in other parts of the page. The bug.html file contains the buggy code, and bugSolution.html offers a solution.  This is a great example of how browser inconsistencies can impact simple tasks and highlighting the importance of robust error handling.
